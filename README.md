## LangSplit
I made this mod so my siblings can learn English while still being able to play the game in Swedish. 
What it does is getting the translation from the specified language file and displays the translation next to or under the current language. 

This mod is for Forge and Fabric, it is fully client side and doesn't do anything if installed on a server.

 

### Current features:
 * It translates most text in the game that has a translation.
 * It translates tooltips for items in the inventory.
 * Select a secondary language to display.
 * Inline translation or on two rows.
 * Select a color for the translated text.
 * Color blending to make the selected color mix with already colored text.
 * Works with resource packs that contains translations.
 * Mod friendly! :)

 

### Compatibility:

It should translate text in any mod as long as the mod has translation for that language (otherwise it should safely ignore the translation).

 

### Permission:

You can use my mods in any modpack as long as the host remains on CurseForge or Modrinth.
